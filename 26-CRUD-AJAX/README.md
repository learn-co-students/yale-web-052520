# CRUD-AJAX

## Learning Goals
- [ ] Create `fetch` requests (including `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM in conjunction with `fetch` calls
- [ ] Understand optimistic vs pessimistic rendering
    - Updating UI/DOM

### Deliverables (User Stories)
- [x] As a user, I should see all the Books
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to create new Book
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to edit a clicked Book
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to delete a Book on click of a button

These changes should _persist_ in our database.
